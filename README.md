Project Title: Design of a Wearable and Portable Non-Invasive External Ventilation (NIEV)

	Background:
In patients with repaired single-chamber circulation called Fontan circulation, the systemic venous return is directed to lung vessels without another pumping chamber. Thus, some degree of venous congestion with high venous pressure is needed for Fontan patients in order to deliver the venous blood to the single-pumping chamber over the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As a result, many Fontan patients develop symptoms of systemic venous congestion and exercise intolerance in the long term, known as the failing Fontan circulation. There is no fundamental solution to improve progressive failing Fontan circulation. In our previous study, commercially available non-invasive external ventilation (NIEV) increased pulmonary blood flow and subsequently cardiac output in the Fontan patients by enhancing the chest wall expansion and to decrease in PVR during respiration. However, this device is cumbersome and designed for only hospital use.
	
 Project description:
We are aiming two goals in this study: 1) to demonstrate the effectiveness of NIEV on Fontan circulation by using the computational flow dynamic simulation, 2) to develop a wearable and portable NIEV device. In Stage 1, Investigation of the effectiveness of NIEV on various mechanisms of failing Fontan circulation will be performed by means of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation. In Stage 2, Development of a wearable and portable NIEV device will be achieved.
	In this multidisciplinary capstone design project, the client expects the team to design the following:
The Fontan jacket will incorporate a controller and pressurization device for synchronization of the biphasic ventilation to respiration. Additionally, the Fontan jacket will be designed to reduce impact on the patient's daily life. These are achieved following two steps: 1) development of a computational model of the coupled fluid-structure interaction by integrating the developed CFD model with a finite element model of the device, 2) building and testing of the proposed design based on 3D CFD modelling, rapid prototyping and development of a high-fidelity test rig.
